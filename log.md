# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 9, 2018   


**Today's Progress**:  
1. Solved some hackerank quizes.
2. Worked on my Todo List web app using django.  


**Thoughts:**  

I'm starting to appreciate the dynamics of python as multi-purpose programming language. Coming from a php background, to me DJango is easier, better, more secure and very robust. I can't wait to develop more projects

### Day 1: February 10, 2018  

**Today's Progress**  

1. Started learning reactJS.
2. Worked some more on my todo-list.  

**Thoughts:**  
I went through the official react tutorial but I didn't really grasp the fundamentals of react. I'm starting a new tutorial on 12th which I hope will be better.

### Day 2: February 11, 2018  

**Today's Progress**  

1. Started working on a web app for a side project I've been putting off for a while.  

**Thoughts:**  
I worked with CSS variables for the first time but I still prefer SASS variables.  

### Day 3: February 12, 2018  

**Today's Progress**  

1. Learned about webpack and babel.  
2. Worked on my web app. Added a responsive side nav.
3. My team made a presentation(not the actual competition, more of talking about our idea) about smart homes for an intervarsity competition we applied.   

**Thoughts:**  
Javascript is awesome and messed up in its own way. But I love it! I had a hard time configuring webpack though.  

### Day 4: February 13, 2018  

**Today's Progress**  
1. Learned about components, state and props in ReactJS.
2. Started designing the Web App for the intervarsity competition.
3. Finished the frontend part for my side project.  

**Thoughts:**  
I'm starting to grasp the fundamentals of react and it's pretty interesting.  

### Day 5: February 14, 2018
**Note**  
Valentine's is overrated! Don't wait for valentines to show love. The world is filled with hate but keep erasing it somehow.  

**Today's Progress**  
1. Learned about validating props in React using the 'prop-types' library.  
2. Finished the design for the smart home mobile app.  
3. Learned about fullPageJs.  

### Day 6: February 15, 2018  

**Today's Progress**  
1. Designed the smart home web app.
2. Created a few templates using fullPageJs.

**Thoughts**
I think I've taken a more time than necessary in designing the smart home web app considering the tight deadline. I hope I'll finish it up tomorrow so that I can code it.  

### Day 7: February 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**
1. Learned about React Component API, Component Lifecycle, React Forms, Events, Refs and Keys.  
2. Finished the design of the smart home web app.  

**Thoughts**  
Adobe really killed it with Adobe XD. I personally found photoshop a bit difficult to design and prototype with.  

### Day 8: February 17, 2018  

**Today's Progress**  
1. Attended a Google Cloud Study Jam meetup at my campus. Learned about Kubernetes and Docker.  
2. Started coding the smart home web app.  

**Thoughts**
I'm thinking it;s time I adopted cloud technologies for development. I was a bit hesitant beacuse I thought the learning curve would take up much of my time but today I found out it was really easy. Though I'm opting for AWS instead of GCP.  

### Day 9: February 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**  
1. Finished coding the basic implementation of the smart home web app. I'll meet with my team members tomorrow for feedback before I finish it.  
2. Started an android project. Implemented the basic features and init.  

**Thoughts**  
I've not done android in a while and I've become a little rusty. I hope to get back on track.  
  
### Day 10: February 19, 2018  

**Today's Progress**
1. Implemented the tariffs class on my android project and the calculation of rates for one service(Eazzy Banking).  
2. Solved a bug on the smart home web app that was making the navbar position to vary and even dissappear.  

**Thoughts**  
I had so much fun coding android today. I also replaced some if statements with switch since the values were definite.  

### Day 11: February 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**  
1. Learned about react router flux, redux, animations and higher order components.  
2. Implemented the calculation of rates for the other services in my app (M-Pesa and Airtel Money).  

**Thoughts**
Finished the react tutorial. Now on to creating awesome projects with it! Gotta start react native now as I practice react. This year it's all about javascript and maybe blockchain.  

### Day 12: February 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**
1. Worked on the smart home web app alot. Made it responsive and finished it.

1. Did some final touches on the smart home website. Added a custom animation too.
