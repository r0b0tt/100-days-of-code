# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 9, 2018   


**Today's Progress**:  
1. Solved some hackerank quizes.
2. Worked on my Todo List web app using django.  


**Thoughts:**  

I'm starting to appreciate the dynamics of python as multi-purpose programming language. Coming from a php background, to me DJango is easier, better, more secure and very robust. I can't wait to develop more projects

### Day 1: February 10, 2018  

**Today's Progress**  

1. Started learning reactJS.
2. Worked some more on my todo-list.  

**Thoughts:**  
I went through the official react tutorial but I didn't really grasp the fundamentals of react. I'm starting a new tutorial on 12th which I hope will be better.

### Day 2: February 11, 2018  

**Today's Progress**  

1. Started working on a web app for a side project I've been putting off for a while.  

**Thoughts:**  
I worked with CSS variables for the first time but I still prefer SASS variables.  

### Day 3: February 12, 2018  

**Today's Progress**  

1. Learned about webpack and babel.  
2. Worked on my web app. Added a responsive side nav.
3. My team made a presentation(not the actual competition, more of talking about our idea) about smart homes for an intervarsity competition we applied.   

**Thoughts:**  
Javascript is awesome and messed up in its own way. But I love it! I had a hard time configuring webpack though.  

### Day 3: February 12, 2018  

**Today's Progress**  
1. Learned about components, state and props in ReactJS.
2. Started designing the Web App for the intervarsity competition.
3. Finished the frontend part for my side project.  

**Thoughts:**  
I'm starting to grasp the fundamentals of react and it's pretty interesting.
