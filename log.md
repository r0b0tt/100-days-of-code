# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 9, 2017 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**:  
1. Solved some hackerank quizes.
2. Worked on my Todo List web app using django. 

**Thoughts:**  
I'm starting to appreciate the dynamics of python as multi-purpose programming language. Coming from a php background, to me DJango is easier, better, more secure and very robust. I can't wait to develop more projects
